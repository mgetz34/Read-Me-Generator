## Description

For this project we wanted to build a command line interface appliction utilizing Node.js and specifically; the Inquirer package. Two indiviual JS files were
used to produce a dynamiacally created README.md file for this assignment. Using the Node.js FS
module and Require method, data was imported from user input on the console, to produce a README
file for this or any project. This application solves the problem of producing one of the most important pieces of any new application; the README. On demand README generation allows the developer to focus on the code for the application, and streamlines efficency.
